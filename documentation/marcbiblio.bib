    by normalizing the functions to integrate to 1 can be approximated
    by Monte Carlo simulation, the only regularity conditions being
    a compactification of the parameter space such that the evaluation
    maps $\theta \mapsto h\sb \theta(x)$ remain continuous. Then
    with probability 1 the Monte Carlo approximant to the log-likelihood
    hypoconverges to the exact log- likelihood, its maximizer converges
    to the exact maximum likelihood estimate, approximations to profile
    likelihoods hypoconverge to the exact profile and level sets

    exact sets (in Painlevé-Kuratowski set convergence).\par

abstract="{We estimate a probability density function $p$ which is related
    by a linear operator $K$ to a density function $q$ in sequences
    of regular exponential families based on a random sample from
    $q$. Deconvolution and positron emission tomography are considered.
    The logarithm of the density function is approximated by basis
    functions consisting of singular functions of $K$. While direct
    maximum likelihood (or minimum Kullback-Leibler) density estimation
    in exponential families selects the parameters to match the moments
    of the basis functions to the sample moments, in the inverse
    problem the moment of each singular function is related to a
    corresponding moment of the direct problem by a factor given
    by a singular value $\lambda_\nu$ of $K$. Thus an appropriate
    analogue of the maximum likelihood estimate is obtained by matching
    moments with respect to $p$ to $1/\lambda_\nu$ times the empirical
    moments associated with the sample from $q$.\par
Bounds on the
    Kullback-Leibler distance between the true density and the estimators
    are obtained and rates of convergence are established for log-density
    functions having a measure of smoothness. The density estimator
    converges to the unknown density in the Kullback-Leibler sense
    and in the $L_2$-sense at a rate determined not only by the order
    of smoothness of the log-density and the dimension of data but
    also by the decay rate of the singular values of the operator.
    A minimax lower bound for deconvolution is provided under certain
    conditions. Numerical examples using simulated data are provided
    to illustrate the finite-sample performance of the proposed method
    for deconvolution and positron emission tomography.}",

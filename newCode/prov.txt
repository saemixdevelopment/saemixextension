, and two approaches have been proposed using either numerical integration by a combination of MC and adaptive Gaussian quadrature (MC/AGQ, Ueckert et al 2017) or stochastic integration by MCMC (Rivi√®re et al. 2017). Both these approaches are computationally intensive. They require to define the elementary FIM associated to the observed design (here, the number of times and the gender which enters the model), and sum over all the subjects sharing the same design. Here, as in the *toenail* example, the subjects in the real dataset *rapi.saemix* were not all seen at the same times. This makes the computation of an exact FIM somewhat cumbersome, especially when stratifying on gender, as we need to compute the FIM in each combination of gender and observation times and sum the elementary FIM.
